## Research Questions

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?

-- Git is a version control system used for managing and tracking file revisions.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

--Git is used to manage and track code, and GitHub is a cloud based hosting service that is used for storing and tracking code, and collaborating on projects.

3. Why do we create a branch?

-- We create branches to work on different features. New branches allows us to make changes without affecting the main.

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?

-- Pull requests allows collaborators to review, and comment on any changes made before approving merge.

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.

-- git checkout BRANCH-NAME

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?

-- `git fetch` pulls in all commits from the remote repository, but it does not change our local files.

-- `git merge` combines two separate branches to integrate changes

-- `git pull` downloads commits from a remote repository and updates current local branch

7. What is a merge conflict?

-- A merge conflict occurs when there are conflicting changes to the same line of code.

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?

-- Most direct way: edit the conflicted file in editor or IDE
In merge editor we can review conflicts line by line and decide which version we would like to keep.
